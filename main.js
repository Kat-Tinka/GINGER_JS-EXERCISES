/*Exercise 1
In your JavaScript file create a variable called myName with your name as the value. Put your name inside string quotes, e.g., "my name". Then add a line of code to print the variable name to the console after the previous message.

Save your JavaScript file in your editor. Reload the HTML page in your browser. You should see your name printed. If not, investigate and fix it.*/

let myName = ("Karolina"   "Thorwarth");


console.log(myName);
