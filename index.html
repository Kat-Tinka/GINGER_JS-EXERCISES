    Set up a JavaScript playground
    Since you'll be learning to write JavaScript for web pages, the best way to experiment is by making a very simple web page that loads and runs some JavaScript. You may find this page useful when testing out ideas in later tasks.

    Create a directory for your code, e.g., JS-exercises
    Inside that directory, create an HTML file, e.g., index.html
    In the HTML file, put some simple HTML to show some text that will let you know you're looking at the right file, e.g., an h1 tag for the title
    In the same directory, create the file main.js
    Add a script element to your index.html to load JavaScript from the file main.js: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/html-script-tag
    Tip: in this case, the script tag should be right before the closing </body> tag
    In the JavaScript file, add a line into your JavaScript file to print the following text in the console: "Starting javascript...". In programming, printing to some console window is often called "logging". Hence the function to use in JavaScript is console.log: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-console-log-with-examples/
    Open your HTML file in a browser
    Open the developer console. Is your message there? If not, try reloading the file
    Tip: if you still don't see the message, check your HTML and JavaScript file for typos. Make sure the file names match exactly, including case. Make sure the JavaScript file is in the same directory as the HTML file.

    Tip: as you do the exercises below, keep adding new code for each exercise
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
